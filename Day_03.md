# 🔍 **Understanding Individuals and Variables**  

### 🏷️ **What Are Individuals & Variables?**  
✅ **Individual**: An item in a dataset (e.g., a person, a product, or a location).  
✅ **Variable**: A property or characteristic of an individual (e.g., **Hours of Study** for a student).  

### 🔄 **Independent vs. Dependent Variables**  
🔹 **Independent Variable (Feature)**: Helps **predict** an outcome (e.g., **Hours of Study** affecting grades).  
🔹 **Dependent Variable (Label)**: The **predicted value** based on independent variables (e.g., **Grade**).  
💡 In **Machine Learning**, models learn patterns where:  
📌 **One or more Independent Variables → Predict Dependent Variables**  

---

# 🏆 **Types of Variables – Qualitative vs. Quantitative**  

### 🎭 **Qualitative (Categorical) Variables**  
✅ **Non-numeric** and represent categories.  
✅ **Example**: A student’s grade (**A, B, C**).  
🔹 These are known as **Levels or Scales** and can be further divided into:  
📌 **Nominal**: No specific order (e.g., Colors – Red, Blue, Green).  
📌 **Ordinal**: Ordered but differences between values are **not** measurable (e.g., Grades – A, B, C).  

### 🔢 **Quantitative Variables**  
✅ **Numeric** and measurable (e.g., **Hours of Study, Age, Salary**).  
🔹 These can be subdivided into:  
📌 **Discrete**: Countable values (e.g., Rank: **1, 2, 3** but **not** 1.8).  
📌 **Continuous**: Can take any value within a range (e.g., **Height: 5ft 5in 5cm 2mm**).  
Further divided into:  
📌 **Interval**: No true zero point (e.g., Temperature in °C).  
📌 **Ratio**: True zero exists (e.g., Distance, Income).  

---

# 📊 **Levels/Scales of Measurement of Data**  

Data is classified into **four measurement scales** based on the characteristics and usability of values.  

---

### 🏷️ **1. Nominal Scale – Categorical, No Order**  
✅ **Nominal data** consists of **categories** without any meaningful order.  
✅ **Example**: Gender (Male, Female), Colors (Red, Blue, Green), Cuisine types (Italian, Mexican, Indian).  
🚫 **Cannot create a hierarchy** – No category is "higher" or "lower" than another.  

---

### 🔢 **2. Ordinal Scale – Ordered, But Unequal Intervals**  
✅ **Ordinal data** maintains an **order/ranking**, but the intervals between values **aren’t consistent**.  
✅ **Example**:  
📌 **Education Level** → High School → Bachelor’s → Master’s  
📌 **Customer Satisfaction** → Satisfied → Neutral → Unsatisfied  
🔹 **Ordinal is more informative than Nominal**, but still lacks precise numerical comparison.  

---

### 🔄 **Interval & Ratio – Numeric Scales**  

### 📈 **3. Interval Scale – Consistent Intervals, No True Zero**  
✅ **Numerically structured data** where intervals are **fixed and move consistently**, but **no absolute zero exists**.  
✅ **Example**:  
📌 **IQ Scores** → The difference between IQ **110 and 120** is the same as **130 and 140**.  
📌 **Calendar Dates, Time of Day** → The difference between **2:00 PM and 3:00 PM** is one hour, but **0:00 AM doesn’t mean "no time"**.  
📌 **Temperatures in Celsius & Fahrenheit** → 0°C **does not** mean "no heat" exists!  

🔹 **Understanding "True Zero" Concept**  
Zero in Interval data **does not represent an absence of the property**.  
📌 **Example**: Exam scoring:  
✔ If **no negative marking**, 0 marks means the **starting point**.  
❌ If **negative marking**, 0 marks doesn’t mean "no performance" – a student can still score **below zero**.  

---

### 🏆 **4. Ratio Scale – True Zero Exists**  
✅ **Ratio scale** is the **most powerful** because both **intervals and ratios** are meaningful.  
✅ **A true zero exists**, meaning **0 represents "nothing"**.  
✅ **Example**:  
📌 **Height, Weight, Income** → 0 cm means "no height," 0 kg means "no weight."  
📌 **Distance traveled** → If **a car has traveled 0 km, it literally didn’t move**.  

🔹 **Ratio is the BEST, Nominal is the most basic.**  
📌 **Hierarchy**:  
✔ **Ratio** > **Interval** > **Ordinal** > **Nominal**  

---

# 📊 **Measures of Location & Dispersion**  

### 🎯 **Measures of Location (Central Tendency) – Finding the Center of Data**  
✅ **Definition**: A single value that represents the “centering” of a dataset, helping us understand **where most values lie**.  
✅ **Includes**: **Mean, Mode, and Median**.  
📌 Example: Marks obtained by **10 students**, arranged in ascending order:  
**45, 56, 61, 65, 68, 71, 73, 79, 82, 88, 91**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ef12b43-91a1-4c15-9f4b-2cbee2b2de9a)  

---

### 🔄 **Measures of Dispersion – Understanding Variation in Data**  
✅ **Definition**: Measures **how spread out** the data points are from the center.  
✅ **Includes**:  
📌 **Range (Interquartile Range - IQR)** – The difference between the highest and lowest values.  
📌 **Variance** – Measures how far numbers are **spread out from the mean**.  
📌 **Standard Deviation** – Quantifies the **amount of variation** in the dataset.  

---

# ⚖ **Choosing the Right Measure**  

### ✅ **Mean** – Used for **normally distributed data** without extreme outliers.  
✅ Best for **interval and ratio** data.  

### ✅ **Median** – Used when data is **skewed** (has extreme values).  
✅ Best for **ordinal, interval, and ratio** data.  

### ✅ **Mode** – Identifies the most **frequent value** in a dataset.  
✅ Best for **categorical (nominal) data**, but applicable to all four scales.  

📌 **Normally Distributed Data** – Mean works best:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64a4b852-730e-4e99-acbb-ce985645b798)  

📌 **Skewed Data** – Median is preferred:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54a41ec7-41d7-4491-9192-b93a8dec8116)  

---

# 🔢 **Mean (Average)**  

📌 **Formula**:  
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}
\]
✅ Mean **can be affected by outliers**.  
Example:  
📌 **Test Scores**: **70, 80, 90, 85, 75** → **Mean = 80**  
📌 **Test Scores with an Outlier**: **70, 80, 90, 85, 75, 2** → **Mean = 66** (Outlier impacts the result!)  

---

# 🔄 **Median (Middle Value)**  

📌 **How It Works**:  
✅ Sort numbers in ascending order, find the middle value.  
✅ If **odd number of values**, the middle value is the median.  
✅ If **even number of values**, the median is the **average of the two middle values**.  

Example:  
📌 **Scores**: **62, 78, 84, 89, 91, 95, 97** → **Median = 89**  
📌 **Scores**: **62, 78, 84, 89, 91, 95** → **Median = (84 + 89) / 2 = 86.5**  

💡 **Why is the Median Not Affected by Outliers?**  
✅ Because **outliers exist at extremes**, and median **ignores extreme values!**  

Example:  
📌 **Mean** of **56, 78, 45, 49, 55, 62** = **57.5**  
📌 **Mean** of **56, 180, 45, 49, 55, 62** = **74.5** (Outlier affects it!)  
📌 **Median remains constant at 55.5** in both cases!  

---

# 🔎 **Mode (Most Frequently Occurring Value)**  

📌 **How It Works**:  
✅ The value that appears **most frequently** in a dataset.  

Example:  
📌 **Data**: **62, 78, 84, 89, 91, 95, 97, 89, 91, 89**  
✅ **Mode** = **89** (Appears **3 times**, highest frequency).  

### 📌 **Types of Mode-Based Data**  
✅ **Bi-modal** – Two modes  
✅ **Tri-modal** – Three modes  
✅ **Multimodal** – More than three modes  

🔹 **Mode involves no calculations—just counting!**  

---

# 📉 **Measures of Dispersion – Understanding Spread in Data**  

✅ **Spread shows how scattered data points are around the central value.**  
✅ If dispersion is **low**, most values are **close to the center**.  
✅ If dispersion is **high**, values are **widely spread**.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ad37d7a-28bb-45c3-9832-429a31ddcfd3)  

---

# 📏 **Understanding Range & Percentiles**  

### 🔹 **Range – Measuring Data Spread**  
📌 **Definition**: The difference between the **maximum** and **minimum** values in a dataset.  
📌 **Formula**:  
\[
\text{Range} = \text{Max Value} - \text{Min Value}
\]
✅ **Affected by outliers**, making it an unreliable measure in some cases.  

📌 **Example**:  
Data: **8, 11, 5, 9, 7, 6, 2500**  
\[
\text{Range} = 2500 - 5 = 2495
\]
🚨 **Problem**: The extreme value **2500** skews the range, making it meaningless!  

📌 **Solution?** **Interquartile Range (IQR)** – A better approach that ignores extreme values.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/965538e2-6704-47af-8518-f421feae94ef)  

---

# 🎯 **Percentiles – Understanding Relative Ranking**  

### 📌 **Percentile vs. Percentage**  
✅ **Percentile**: A value below which a **certain percentage** of observations fall.  
✅ **Percentage**: An absolute comparison.  

📌 **Example Interpretation**:  
🔹 If you're in the **90th percentile** in an exam, **90% of students scored below you**, and **10% scored higher**.  
🔹 If a patient’s **blood pressure is in the 60th percentile**, **60% of patients have lower blood pressure**, while **40% have higher values**.  

📌 **Key Idea**: The **Median** is the **50th percentile**, meaning **half of the values lie below and half above**.  

---

## 🔢 **Percentile Example**  

📌 **General Percentile Graph**  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c7bc7b0-72d7-41b9-ad34-842b7294f288)  

📌 **Score at the 62nd Percentile**  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60e75f0e-0037-43af-9171-35bf1334ce16)  

🔹 **Sorted Marks of 20 Students**:  
65, 72, 78, 80, 81, 83, 85, 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100  

### 🔍 **Finding Percentiles in a Dataset**  

📌 **10th Percentile Position Calculation**  
\[
\frac{10}{100} \times (\text{Total Observations} + 1) = \frac{10}{100} \times 21 = 2.10
\]
✅ The **10th percentile is at position ~2**, meaning the marks are **(72 + 78) / 2 = 75**  
**Interpretation**: **10% of students scored below 75 marks, while 90% scored higher**.  

📌 **90th Percentile Position Calculation**  
\[
\frac{90}{100} \times 21 = 18.9 \approx (98 + 99) / 2 = 98.5
\]
✅ Marks at the **90th percentile = 98.5**  
**Interpretation**: **90% of students scored below 98.5, and 10% scored higher**.  

### 🎯 **Finding Percentile of a Given Score (85 Marks)**  
📌 Formula:  
\[
\frac{\text{Number of observations below the score}}{\text{Total observations}} \times 100
\]
✅ **For 85 marks**:  
\[
\frac{6}{20} \times 100 = 30
\]
**85 marks are at the 30th percentile** → **30% of students scored below 85, while 70% scored higher**.  

📌 **Important Note**: Here we use **Number of observations**, **not** Number of observations +1.

🌟 **Quartiles & Inter Quartile Range (IQR) Explained Simply!** 📊

## 🏆 Quartiles – Breaking Data into Four Equal Parts
Think of quartiles as cutting a cake into four equal slices! 🎂 Each slice represents a portion of data that helps us understand distributions better.

### 🧩 **Percentile vs Quartile**
- **Percentile**: Divides data into **100** equal parts.
- **Quartile**: Divides data into **4** equal parts.

### 📏 **Quartile Definitions**
- **First Quartile (Q1)**: 25th percentile (lower quarter of data).
- **Second Quartile (Q2)**: 50th percentile (median of the data).
- **Third Quartile (Q3)**: 75th percentile (upper quarter of data).

🔢 **Example: Sorted Marks of 20 students**
`65,72,78,80,81,83,85,87,88,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100`

#### 🏗 **Finding Quartiles**
Formula:  
`Position of Qx = (Percentile/100) × (n+1)`

- **Q1 Calculation**: `(25/100) × 21 = 5.25` → Take the average of the **5th and 6th values** → `(81+83)/2 = 82`
- **Q2 Calculation** (Median): `(50/100) × 21 = 10.5` → Average of **10th and 11th values** → `(90+91)/2 = 90.5`
- **Q3 Calculation**: `(75/100) × 21 = 15.75` → Average of **15th and 16th values** → `(95+96)/2 = 95.5`

🖼️ **Box Plot Representation** – This visualizes quartiles and spread:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc5d962a-af84-4579-97e2-2055efb224b9)

---

## 🎯 **Inter Quartile Range (IQR) – Measuring Spread** 
Imagine zooming in on the "middle 50%" of the data to ignore extreme values. **IQR helps us handle outliers!**

### 📌 **Formula:**
`IQR = Q3 – Q1`
- **Example Calculation**: `95.5 – 82 = 13.5`

🔎 **Why is IQR useful?**
- **Ignores extreme values** 🎭 → More **reliable** than range!
- **Resistant to skewed data** → Uses percentiles, **not raw numbers**.
- **Detects Outliers** 🚨 → Helps flag **unusual** values.

### 🛑 **Finding Outliers**
Lower Bound = `Q1 – (1.5 × IQR)` → `82 – (1.5 × 13.5) = 61.75`  
Upper Bound = `Q3 + (1.5 × IQR)` → `95.5 + (1.5 × 13.5) = 102.25`

🌟 **Data points outside this range are outliers!** In our example, no outliers exist!

---

## 🚗 **Outlier Example – Commute Times**
🎯 **Commute times (minutes) for 14 people**  
`16, 8, 35, 17, 13, 15, 15, 5, 16, 25, 20, 20, 12, 10`

### 📊 **Sorted Data**
`5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 15, 16, 16, 17, 20, 20, 25, 35`

📝 **Five-number summary:**  
- **Minimum**: 5  
- **Q1**: 12  
- **Median (Q2)**: 15.5  
- **Q3**: 20  
- **Maximum**: 35  

### 🚨 **Finding Outliers**
- **IQR Calculation**: `Q3 – Q1 = 20 – 12 = 8`
- **Threshold for outliers**:  
  - **Lower Bound**: `Q1 – (1.5 × IQR) = 12 – 12 = 0`
  - **Upper Bound**: `Q3 + (1.5 × IQR) = 20 + 12 = 32`

❌ **Outlier detected!** A **commute time of 35** is **above 32**, so it's an outlier!

## 🛠 **Python Code for Outlier Detection**
Let's visualize commute times with a box plot! 🐍💻

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Data
commuter_times = [16, 8, 35, 17, 13, 15, 15, 5, 16, 25, 20, 20, 12, 10]

# Create the box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(data=commuter_times, orient='h')

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Box Plot of Commuter Times')
plt.xlabel('Minutes')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

📊 **Variance & Standard Deviation Explained Simply!** ✨

## 🎯 **Variance – Understanding Spread in Data**
Variance tells us **how far** data points are from the mean. It helps us understand how **scattered** or **clustered** the data is.

🔍 **Key Takeaways**
- **High variance** = Data is more spread out 🌀  
- **Low variance** = Data is more uniform 🎯  

### 📏 **How to Calculate Variance?**
1️⃣ **Find the mean** of the dataset.  
2️⃣ **Subtract the mean** from each value & **square the result**.  
3️⃣ **Take the average** of these squared values.  

### 📜 **Variance Formula**
#### ✅ **Population Variance** (Whole data)
Formula:  
\[
σ^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}
\]
- \( x_i \) = Data points  
- \( \mu \) = Population mean  
- \( N \) = Number of observations  

#### ✅ **Sample Variance** (Subset of data)
Formula:  
\[
S^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}
\]
- \( x_i \) = Data points  
- \( \bar{x} \) = Sample mean  
- \( n \) = Sample size  

---

## 📌 **Variance Example**
Consider the dataset: **5, 7, 10, 12, 15**

🔹 **Step 1: Calculate Mean**  
\[
\mu = \frac{5 + 7 + 10 + 12 + 15}{5} = 9.8
\]

🔹 **Step 2: Find Squared Differences**
| Data Point | Difference from Mean | Squared Difference |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 5 | \( 5 - 9.8 = -4.8 \) | \( (-4.8)^2 = 23.04 \) |
| 7 | \( 7 - 9.8 = -2.8 \) | \( (-2.8)^2 = 7.84 \) |
| 10 | \( 10 - 9.8 = 0.2 \) | \( (0.2)^2 = 0.04 \) |
| 12 | \( 12 - 9.8 = 2.2 \) | \( (2.2)^2 = 4.84 \) |
| 15 | \( 15 - 9.8 = 5.2 \) | \( (5.2)^2 = 27.04 \) |

🔹 **Step 3: Compute Variance**
\[
σ^2 = \frac{23.04 + 7.84 + 0.04 + 4.84 + 27.04}{5} = 12.56
\]

📌 **Why do we square the differences?**  
- **To avoid cancellations** – Negative & positive values balance out.  
- **To highlight extreme values** – Outliers affect variance more.

---

## 🚨 **Limitation of Variance – How to Quantify?**
Variance can **seem high** but doesn't always **give clear meaning**.  

🔹 **Example:**  
Marks of 10 students: **32, 39, 44, 56, 56, 63, 71, 72, 81, 89**  
Mean \( \mu \) = **60.3**, Variance \( σ^2 \) = **306.81**  

⚠️ **Variance is tricky to interpret** – We need another metric that is **on the same scale** as the data.

---

## 🎯 **Standard Deviation – A More Understandable Measure!**
Since **variance squares differences**, it **does not match the original scale** of data.  
💡 **Standard deviation** fixes this by **taking the square root of variance**.

### 📏 **Formula**
\[
σ = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}
\]
- Standard deviation gives a **direct & understandable measure** of spread! 🎯  

---

## 🏆 **Standard Deviation Example**
Marks of **10 students**:  
`76, 89, 53, 75, 80, 67, 61, 59, 71, 60`

### 📌 **Step 1: Find the Mean**
\[
\mu = \frac{691}{10} = 69.1
\]

### 📌 **Step 2: Compute Squared Differences**
| Data Point | Difference | Squared Difference |
|------------|------------|--------------------|
| 76 | \( 76 - 69.1 = 6.9 \) | \( 47.61 \) |
| 89 | \( 89 - 69.1 = 19.9 \) | \( 396.01 \) |
| 53 | \( 53 - 69.1 = -16.1 \) | \( 259.21 \) |
| 75 | \( 75 - 69.1 = 5.9 \) | \( 34.81 \) |
| 80 | \( 80 - 69.1 = 10.9 \) | \( 118.81 \) |
| 67 | \( 67 - 69.1 = -2.1 \) | \( 4.41 \) |
| 61 | \( 61 - 69.1 = -8.1 \) | \( 65.61 \) |
| 59 | \( 59 - 69.1 = -10.1 \) | \( 102.01 \) |
| 71 | \( 71 - 69.1 = 1.9 \) | \( 3.61 \) |
| 60 | \( 60 - 69.1 = -9.1 \) | \( 82.81 \) |

Total Variance: **1114.90**  
\[
σ^2 = \frac{1114.90}{10} = 111.49
\]
Standard deviation \( σ \) = **√111.49 = 10.56**

🚀 **Interpreting Data Using Standard Deviation & Coefficient of Variation!** 📊  

## **📌 Blood Sugar Levels Interpretation**
We have **two groups** (A & B) with their blood sugar levels. Let's analyze their **spread** and **variability** using standard deviation.

### 🔍 **Comparing Group A & Group B**
| **Group** | **Blood Sugar Levels (mg/dL)** | **Mean (mg/dL)** | **Standard Deviation (SD)** |
|-----------|--------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **A**     | 125, 118, 121, 123, 119, 122, 117, 121, 124, 116, 120, 122, 119, 124, 118, 120, 123, 122, 118, 121 | **120** | **2.35** |
| **B**     | 150, 90, 115, 145, 118, 112, 135, 121, 117, 122, 119, 128, 115, 145, 120, 90, 155, 135, 122, 115 | **120** | **17.31** |

### 🧐 **Key Observations**
✅ **Group A has a much lower SD (2.35 mg/dL)** → This means blood sugar levels in **Group A are more uniform**. Most values are **close to the mean (120 mg/dL)**.  

⚠️ **Group B has a much higher SD (17.31 mg/dL)** → Some people have **high blood sugar (150-155)**, while others have **low (90-112)**. There's **more variability**, meaning **data is spread out**.  

📌 **Conclusion:**  
- **Group A's values are tightly clustered** → More **consistent**.  
- **Group B's values vary widely** → More **heterogeneous** (some fit, some unfit).

## **📏 Standard Deviation Interpretation**
To measure how **far** an individual's blood sugar is from the mean:  
\[
\text{Deviation} = \frac{\text{Data Point} - \text{Mean}}{\text{SD}}
\]

🔹 **Person 1 (125 mg/dL in Group A)**  
\[
\frac{125 - 120}{2.35} = 2.12
\]
→ This person is **2.12 SD away**, meaning their blood sugar is **higher than most others in Group A**.  

🔹 **Person 2 (118 mg/dL in Group A)**  
\[
\frac{118 - 120}{2.35} = -0.85
\]
→ This person is **slightly lower than the average blood sugar level**.

✔️ **The smaller the deviation, the more "normal" the value is!**

## **📈 Coefficient of Variation (CV) – Relative Measure of Variability**
Unlike SD, **CV is expressed in %**, making it independent of units.

### 📜 **Formula**
\[
CV = \frac{SD}{Mean} \times 100
\]

### **Pizza Delivery Example 🍕**
Restaurant **A** → Mean **20 minutes**, SD **5 minutes**  
\[
CV = \frac{5}{20} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Restaurant **B** → Mean **15 minutes**, SD **10 minutes**  
\[
CV = \frac{10}{15} \times 100 = 66\%
\]

🔥 **Interpretation:**  
- **Lower CV = More consistent** ⏳  
- **Higher CV = More variability** 🌀  
- **Restaurant A is more reliable**, while **Restaurant B has unpredictable delivery times**.

### 📊 **Real Example – Student Scores**
| **Student** | **Mean Score** | **Standard Deviation** | **CV (%)** |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|------------|
| **A**      | 80           | 8                    | **10%** |
| **B**      | 75           | 15                   | **20%** |

✅ **Student A is more consistent** since CV is lower.

## **💰 Investment Decision Example**
| **Investment Option** | **Mean Return (%)** | **Standard Deviation (%)** | **CV (%)** |
|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| **Option A**         | 20%                | 15%                         | **75%** |
| **Option B**         | 6%                 | 2%                          | **33%** |

📌 **Lower CV indicates lower risk!**  
- **Option B (CV = 33%) is more stable** 🏦  
- **Option A (CV = 75%) is highly unpredictable** 📉  

🚀 **Conclusion: Option B is a safer investment choice!**

## **📉 Skewness – Understanding Data Shape**
Skewness tells us **how asymmetrical** a dataset is compared to its mean.

📌 **Types of Skewness**
| **Skew Type** | **Tail Direction** | **Most Data** | **Interpretation** |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Right (Positive) Skew** | Right ↗️ | Left ⬅️ | Most values are low |
| **Left (Negative) Skew** | Left ↙️ | Right ➡️ | Most values are high |

### 🎓 **Example – Student Exam Scores**
- **No Skew** → Student marks are **evenly distributed** 📊  
- **Right-Skew** → Most students **fail**, few score high 🥲  
- **Left-Skew** → Most students **score high**, few fail 🎉

## **🔥 Final Takeaways**
✔️ **Standard Deviation helps measure consistency in data.**  
✔️ **Coefficient of Variation (CV) is better for comparing variability across different datasets.**  
✔️ **Skewness tells us whether data is symmetrical or skewed.**  

---

## 📊 Skewness in Data Distribution  

### 🟢 Zero Skew (No-Skew)  
👉 **Mean = Median**  
This means the data is **evenly distributed**, with no bias towards higher or lower values.

---

### 📈 Right-Skewed (Positive Skew)  
🔹 **Most values are on the lower side, with a few high values pulling the tail to the right.**  
🔹 **Mean > Median** → The average is influenced by the few higher values.  
🔹 **Tail is on the right** → Represents **higher values** in the dataset.  
🔹 **More data points are concentrated on the left side.**  
🔹 **Outliers** → High values (extreme cases) are on the right side.  

💡 **Examples:**  
✔️ **Income of People** → Most people earn lower salaries, but a few individuals earn **very high incomes**, pulling the average upward.  
✔️ **Ratings Example** → Most people rate **1 or 2 stars** out of 5, but a few rate it **higher**, creating a right-skewed distribution.

---

### 📉 Left-Skewed (Negative Skew)  
🔹 **Most values are on the higher side, with a few low values pulling the tail to the left.**  
🔹 **Mean < Median** → The average is influenced by the few lower values.  
🔹 **Tail is on the left** → Represents **lower values** in the dataset.  
🔹 **More data points are concentrated on the right side.**  
🔹 **Outliers** → Low values (extreme cases) are on the left side.  

💡 **Examples:**  
✔️ **Age at the time of death** → Most people live **long lives**, but a few **pass away young**, pulling the distribution left.  
✔️ **Ratings Example** → Most people rate **4 or 5 stars** out of 5, but a few rate it **lower**, creating a left-skewed distribution.

## ⭐ Simple Ratings Example  

Imagine **1 lakh people** giving ratings on a scale of **1 to 5**:  

✅ **No-skew (Balanced Ratings)** → All ratings occur **almost equally** (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all get similar votes).  
✅ **Right-skew (Low Ratings Dominate)** → **Most people give 1 or 2 stars**; fewer give **higher ratings**.  
✅ **Left-skew (High Ratings Dominate)** → **Most people give 4 or 5 stars**; fewer give **lower ratings**.

## 🔄 Covariance  

🟢 **What is Covariance?**  
Covariance measures **how two variables change together**—whether they move **in the same direction** or **opposite directions**.  

💡 **Scale:**  
- **Covariance** → Measured in units of what we are analyzing (harder to interpret).  
- **Correlation** → Standardized between **-1 and +1** (easier to interpret).  

### 🏡 Real-Life Example: Area vs Price of a House  
📏 **Area of House** 🏡 | 💰 **Price of House**  
---|---  
1200 sqft | 75 lakhs  
1300 sqft | 90 lakhs  
1500 sqft | 1.10 crores  

👉 As the **area increases**, the **price increases**—but **by how much**? That’s where **Covariance** comes in!

## 📏 Covariance Example  

Covariance helps us understand **how two variables (like height and weight) change together**. If they move **in the same direction**, covariance is **positive**; if they move **opposite**, it's **negative**.  

### 🔢 Given Data  
📏 **Height (X)** | ⚖️ **Weight (Y)**  
---|---  
65 | 68  
67 | 69  
68 | 70  
66 | 69  
64 | 65  

### 📌 Step 1: Calculate Mean  
👉 **Mean Height (x̅)** = (65 + 67 + 68 + 66 + 64) / 5 = **66**  
👉 **Mean Weight (y̅)** = (68 + 69 + 70 + 69 + 65) / 5 = **68.2**  

### 📌 Step 2: Find Differences  
🔹 For Heights: (xi − x̅) → **[−1, 1, 2, 0, −2]**  
🔹 For Weights: (yi − y̅) → **[−0.2, 0.8, 1.8, 0.8, −3.2]**  

### 📌 Step 3: Multiply Differences  
(xi−x̅)(yi−y̅) =  
(-1 × -0.2) + (1 × 0.8) + (2 × 1.8) + (0 × 0.8) + (-2 × -3.2) = **11**

### 📌 Step 4: Apply Covariance Formula  
Cov (X, Y) = **Σ[(xi − x̅)(yi − y̅)] / (n - 1)**  

👉 Cov (X, Y) = **11 / 4** = **2.75**  

**Interpretation:**  
Since covariance is **positive**, height and weight **increase together**. Taller people tend to be heavier! 🏋️‍♂️📏

## 📊 Covariance vs Variance  

🟢 **Covariance Formula:**  
Cov (X,Y) = **Σ[(xi − x̅)(yi − y̅)] / (n - 1)**  

But what happens if we **replace Y with X**? 🤔  

🟢 **Variance Formula:**  
Var (X) = **Σ[(xi − x̅)(xi − x̅)] / (n - 1)**  

👉 **Variance measures how a single variable spreads out.**  
👉 **Covariance tells how two variables relate.**  

💡 **Key Insight:**  
Covariance of X and Y **is just the variance of X and X**! 🔁

## 🔄 Correlation  

Correlation measures **how strongly two variables are related**.  

💡 **Real-life examples:**  
✔️ **Exercise & Health** → More workouts lead to better fitness 🏋️‍♀️  
✔️ **Study & Marks** → More study time leads to higher grades 📚  
✔️ **Experience & Salary** → More experience leads to higher pay 💰  

---

## 📈 Pearson Correlation Coefficient  

✅ **Formula:**  
Corr (X, Y) = **Cov (X, Y) / (σX × σY)**  

**Interpretation:**  
🔹 **+1 → Strong positive correlation** (both increase together)  
🔹 **-1 → Strong negative correlation** (one increases, the other decreases)  
🔹 **0 → No correlation** (no relationship)  

💡 **Examples:**  
✔️ **Positive (0.80)** → More study time 🔁 Higher test scores  
✔️ **Negative (-0.70)** → More TV time 🔁 Lower physical fitness  
✔️ **No correlation (0.02)** → Shoe size vs IQ (totally unrelated!)
