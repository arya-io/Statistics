# 🔍 Conditional Probability to Bayes’ Theorem

## 📌 Understanding Conditional Probability
Conditional probability helps us calculate the likelihood of an event occurring given that another event has already happened.

### ✅ Basic Equation:
P(A,B) = P(A) x P(B|A)
- Here, **A** has already occurred, and we want to determine the probability of **B**, knowing that **A** happened.
- **Conditional Probability Formula:**  
P(B|A) = P(A,B) / P(A)

---

## 🎯 Bayes’ Theorem
Bayes’ Theorem allows us to reverse conditional probabilities by incorporating prior probabilities.

### 🔍 **What is Prior Probability?**  
**Prior Probability** is the probability of an event happening **before** taking any new evidence into account. It’s the initial belief or baseline probability based on existing knowledge or general data.  

### 🎭 **Real-Life Example:**  
Imagine you’re checking the probability of rain tomorrow:  
- **Prior Probability (P(A))** → The probability that it will rain based on historical weather patterns for this time of year.  
- **New Evidence (P(B|A))** → The forecast says there’s a high chance of rain because of cloud formation.  
- **Updated (Posterior) Probability (P(A|B))** → The refined probability of rain **after** considering new forecast data using Bayes’ Theorem.

So, **prior probability is simply what we believe before seeing any new data**. Bayes’ Theorem helps us update this belief when new evidence comes in! 🚀  

💡 **Bayes’ Theorem helps refine our belief**—instead of just relying on test results, we adjust our probability based on previous data.

### 🔢 Bayes’ Theorem Formula:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) x P(A)) / P(B)
- This helps in finding **P(A|B)** when we already know **P(B|A)**.
- **P(A|B)** = Probability of **A**, given that **B** has occurred.
- **P(B|A)** = Probability of **B**, given that **A** has occurred.

---

## 🔄 Two Types of Conditional Probabilities:
1️⃣ **P(A|B)** → Probability of **A**, knowing **B**  
2️⃣ **P(B|A)** → Probability of **B**, knowing **A**

### 🏗 How We Calculate Them:
- **Independent Events Formula:**  
  P(AxB) = P(A) x P(B)
- **Dependent Events Formula:**  
  P(A x B) = P(A) x P(B|A)

Now, let's reverse the equation:

### 🔄 Reverse Equation:
- **Original Equation:**  
  P(A x B) = P(A) x P(B|A)  
  (_Meaning A happens first, then B follows_)
- **Reversed Equation:**  
  P(A x B) = P(B) x P(A|B)  
  (_Meaning B happens first, then A follows_)

## 🚢 Real-Life Example: **Titanic Survival**
Imagine we define:
- **A = Female**
- **B = Survived**

Using conditional probability:
- **Given a passenger is female** → Calculate probability of survival  
  P(female x survived) = P(female) x P(survived | female)
- **Given a passenger survived** → Calculate probability they were female  
  \[ P(female x survived) = P(survived) x P(female | survived)

⚠️ This is NOT Bayes' Theorem yet—just basic conditional probability.

---

## 🔢 Applying Bayes’ Theorem
### 🔹 We know **P(B|A)**, but we want to calculate **P(A|B)**  
That's where **Bayes' Theorem** comes in:

1️⃣ **Start with the basic equation:**  
   P(A,B) = P(A) x P(B|A)
2️⃣ **Rewriting for conditional probability:**  
   P(B|A) = P(A, B) / P(A)

🔄 Now, reversing the equation:
- **Reverse equation:**  
  P(A,B) = P(B) x P(A|B)
- **Rewriting for conditional probability:**  
  P(A|B) = P(A, B) / P(B)

But what is **P(A, B)?** 🤔  
This leads to **Bayes’ Theorem**:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) x P(A)) / P(B)

---

## 🎭 Real-World Application of Bayes’ Theorem
🔍 **Medical Tests:** Suppose a test detects a disease with high accuracy. However, Bayes' theorem helps assess the probability that a person actually has the disease if they test positive.

🌐 **Spam Detection:** Email filters use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that an email is spam based on certain words.

🚗 **Self-Driving Cars:** Autonomous vehicles use Bayes' theorem to predict surrounding traffic behavior based on past data.

---

🚀 **Final Thoughts:**  
Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool for revising probabilities based on new evidence. It’s widely used in machine learning, risk analysis, medical testing, and many other fields.

# 🧮 Bayes’ Theorem Example: Liver Disease & Alcoholism

Bayes’ Theorem allows us to update probabilities based on new information. Let's apply it to a **real-life medical scenario**! 🚑  

---

## 📊 **Given Data:**  
- **10% of patients** entering a clinic have **liver disease** → **P(A) = 0.10**  
- **5% of patients** entering the clinic are **alcoholic** → **P(B) = 0.05**  
- **7% of liver disease patients are alcoholics** → **P(B|A) = 0.07**  

We need to find:  
**P(A|B)** → The probability that a patient has **liver disease**, given that they are **alcoholic**.

---

## 🏗 **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**  
Bayes’ formula is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) x P(A)) / P(B)

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.07 x 0.10) / 0.05

P(A|B) = (0.007 x 0.05) / 0.14

**Result:**  
P(A|B) = 0.14 (or 14%)

---

## 🎯 **Interpretation:**  
If a patient **is an alcoholic**, their probability of having **liver disease** is **14%**. This means alcoholics have a **higher risk** of liver disease than the general population, but it’s not a certainty.

---

## 🌐 **Why Is This Important?**  
Bayes’ Theorem helps doctors **refine medical predictions** based on known risk factors. Instead of assuming all alcoholics have liver disease, it adjusts the probability using real-world medical data.

# ☔ Rain Prediction Using Bayes’ Theorem  

Bayes' Theorem helps us refine probability estimates based on new evidence. Let's apply it to predicting rain! 🌧️  

---

## 📊 **Given Data:**  
- **Overall historical probability of rain** → **P(R) = 0.30** (i.e. 30%)  
- **Probability of overcast sky given that it’s raining** → **P(Overcast | Rain) = 0.8**  
- **Probability of clear sky given that it’s raining** → **P(Clear-sky | Rain) = 0.2**  
- **Probability of overcast sky overall** → **P(Overcast) = 0.6**  

We need to calculate:  
**P(Rain | Overcast)** → The probability that **it will rain**, given that **the sky is overcast today**.

---

## 🏗 **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**  
Bayes’ formula is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) x P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- **A = Rain**
- **B = Overcast sky condition**  

Substituting values:

P(Rain | Overcast) = (P(Overcast | Rain) x P(Rain)) / P(Overcast)

P(Rain | Overcast) = (0.8 x 0.3) / 0.6

P(Rain | Overcast) = 0.24 / 0.6 = 0.40

**Result:**  
P(Rain | Overcast) = 0.40 (or 40%)

---

## 🌦 **Interpretation:**  
Since today is **overcast**, the probability that **it will rain today** is **40%**. This means rain is more likely compared to the historical probability, but it’s still not guaranteed.

---

## 🌍 **Real-World Relevance:**  
Bayes' Theorem helps meteorologists refine weather predictions based on new data, such as cloud coverage, humidity levels, and atmospheric pressure.

# 🔥 Bayes’ Theorem Example: Fire & Smoke  

Bayes’ Theorem helps us refine probability estimates based on new evidence. Let's apply it to predicting whether smoke means a **dangerous fire**! 🚒  

---

## 📊 **Given Data:**  
- **Probability of a dangerous fire occurring** → **P(Fire) = 0.01** (i.e. 1%)  
- **Probability of smoke occurring overall** → **P(Smoke) = 0.10** (i.e. 10%)  
- **Probability of smoke, given that a dangerous fire is happening** → **P(Smoke | Fire) = 0.90** (i.e. 90%)  

We need to calculate:  
**P(Fire | Smoke)** → The probability that **a fire is dangerous**, given that we see **smoke**.

---

## 🏗 **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**  
Bayes’ formula is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) x P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- **A = Dangerous Fire**
- **B = Smoke**  

Substituting values:

P(Fire | Smoke) = (P(Smoke | Fire) x P(Fire)) / P(Smoke)

P(Fire | Smoke) = 0.90 x 0.01 / 0.10

P(Fire | Smoke) = 0.009 / 0.10 = 0.09

**Result:**  
P(Fire | Smoke) = 0.09 (or 9%)

---

## 🚒 **Interpretation:**  
If we **see smoke**, the probability that it is due to a **dangerous fire** is **9%**. This means that while smoke often appears due to less dangerous sources (like barbecues), there is still a notable chance that it indicates an actual fire emergency.

---

## 🌍 **Real-World Relevance:**  
Bayes' Theorem helps firefighters and emergency responders **assess risk levels** based on available data, ensuring proper action is taken. It is also used in **fire alarm systems** to reduce false alarms while detecting real dangers.

# 💰 Conditional Probability to Bayes’ Theorem in Loan Approval  

Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem help in **credit scoring and loan approvals**. Let’s break it down! 🚀  

---

## 📊 **Understanding Conditional Probability:**  
Conditional probability tells us the likelihood of one event **given** that another event has already occurred.  

Example:  
👉 **P(Good Credit Rating | Loan Approved)** → Probability that a person has a **good credit rating**, given that their **loan is approved**.

### ✅ Formula for Conditional Probability:  
P(A | B) = P(A,B) / {P(B)

Where:
- **A = Good credit rating**
- **B = Loan approved**  

Thus:
P(Good Credit Rating | Loan Approved) = (P(Good Credit Rating and Loan Approved)) / P(Loan Approved)

---

## 🎯 **Applying Bayes’ Theorem:**  
Bayes’ Theorem helps us reverse the probability. Instead of finding the probability of **having a good credit rating when the loan is approved**, we now find **the probability of getting loan approval when someone has a good credit rating**.

👉 **P(Loan Approved | Good Credit Rating)** → Probability that a person’s **loan is approved**, given that they have a **good credit rating**.

### 🔢 Bayes’ Theorem Formula:  
P(B | A) = (P(A | B) x P(B)) / P(A)

Substituting our variables:


P(Loan Approved | Good Credit Rating) = (P(Good Credit Rating | Loan Approved) x P(Loan Approved)) / P(Good Credit Rating)

---

## 🌐 **Real-Life Application:**  
Banks and lending institutions use Bayes’ Theorem to **assess loan approval chances based on past customer behavior**. If someone has a **good credit rating**, they are statistically more likely to be **approved for a loan**.  

💡 **Takeaway:**  
Bayes' Theorem helps **reverse conditional probabilities**, allowing financial institutions to make **data-driven decisions** in credit risk analysis.  

---

# 🎲 Understanding **Random Variables**  

In an experiment, we are often more interested in a **function of the outcome** rather than every individual outcome itself. This function is what we call a **random variable**.

---

## 🔍 **Definition of Random Variables:**  
A **random variable** is a function that assigns numerical values to outcomes in a sample space. Instead of focusing on each transaction or occurrence, we track a more meaningful quantity.

### 🏦 **Example: Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions**  
Imagine analyzing **1000 credit card transactions**.  
- We are **not** interested in each transaction individually.  
- We **are** interested in knowing **what percentage were fraud**.

Here, the **random variable (Y)** represents the **number of frauds** in a given sample.

📌 **Example with 3 transactions:**  
- Fraud (F), No Fraud (N)
- **Possible values of Y (Fraud Count):**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0760379e-2819-4630-85e1-15bcde04baaf)

Thus, instead of tracking every transaction, we assign **fraud counts** using a **random variable Y**.

---

## 🛡 **Example: Life Insurance Payouts**  

A life insurance agent has **two elderly clients**.  
- Each client's policy has a payout value of **₹1 crore** upon death.  
- The events are **independent**.  

Here, the **random variable (X)** represents the **total money paid out** based on whether the clients pass away.

### **Possible values for X:**
1️⃣ **₹0 crore** (Nobody dies)  
2️⃣ **₹1 crore** (One dies)  
3️⃣ **₹2 crores** (Both die)  

### 📊 **Probability Calculations:**
| **Event**            | **Probability**  | **Calculation**               | **Result** |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------|
| **0 (Nobody dies)** | P(Y′O′)         | 0.95 × 0.90                   | **85.5%**  |
| **1 (One dies)**    | P(YO′) + P(Y′O) | (0.05 × 0.90) + (0.95 × 0.10) | **14%**    |
| **2 (Both die)**    | P(YO)           | 0.05 × 0.10                   | **0.5%**   |

Thus, the **random variable X** summarizes payouts efficiently instead of tracking individual outcomes.

---

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways:**  
✅ **Random variables** help us **simplify complex outcomes** into meaningful numbers.  
✅ Instead of studying each event, we analyze **aggregate probabilities**.  
✅ This technique is used in **finance, insurance, risk analysis, and fraud detection**.  

---

# 🎲 Random Variable Types  

Random variables help us **assign numerical values** to outcomes. Based on their nature, they can be categorized into **Discrete** or **Continuous** random variables.

---

## 🔢 **Discrete Random Variable**  
A **discrete random variable** can only take on a **countable** number of possible values. These values are often whole numbers.

📌 **Examples:**  
- **Credit Ratings:** AAA, AA, B, BBB, etc.  
- **Number of Orders Received:** 0, 1, 2, 3… (counts transactions).  
- **Customer Churn:** 0 = No churn, 1 = Churn.  

In each case, the values are **distinct and countable**.

---

## 📏 **Continuous Random Variable**  
A **continuous random variable** can take **any value within a range**, including decimals. These values are measured rather than counted.

📌 **Examples:**  
- **Market Share of a Company:** Can be **any percentage** between 0% and 100% (e.g., **45.123%**).  
- **Time Taken to Place an Order:** Can vary with precision (e.g., **2.5 minutes** or **2.55 minutes**).  
- **Waiting Time at an ATM:** Can be a precise duration (e.g., **30.2 seconds** or **45.76 seconds**).  

Such variables **vary smoothly across an interval** rather than jumping between separate values.

---

# 📊 Probability Distribution  

A **probability distribution** describes all the probable outcomes of a variable.

## 📌 **Types of Distributions:**  

### 🔹 **Discrete Probability Distribution**  
- The **sum of all individual probabilities** must equal **1**.  
- Example: The probability of rolling numbers on a **6-sided die** (Each number has a defined chance of appearing).  

### 🔹 **Continuous Probability Distribution**  
- The **total area under the probability density curve** must equal **1**.  
- Example: **Height distribution** of people in a population (where probabilities smoothly change over the possible values).  

---

### 📷 **Visual Representation:**  
Below are images illustrating probability distributions:

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways:**  
✅ **Discrete variables** deal with countable values (e.g., number of customers, transactions).  
✅ **Continuous variables** deal with measurable values (e.g., time, weight).  
✅ Probability distributions help in **understanding the likelihood of different outcomes**.

# 📊 Probability Distribution Types & Estimations  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df347f72-48f4-4717-b5c4-7fcc4121ec5c)

A **probability distribution** helps describe the possible values a random variable can take and their corresponding probabilities. Probability distributions are broadly classified into **Discrete** and **Continuous** distributions. Let’s explore them in detail! 🚀  

---

## 🔢 **Discrete Probability Distributions**  
Discrete distributions deal with **countable outcomes** (e.g., rolling a die, number of customers arriving at a store). The sum of all probabilities must be **1**.

### 📌 **Common Types of Discrete Distributions:**  
1️⃣ **Uniform Distribution** → Equal probability for all outcomes (e.g., rolling a fair die 🎲).  
2️⃣ **Binomial Distribution** → Models repeated **success/failure** trials (e.g., flipping a coin multiple times 🪙).  
3️⃣ **Poisson Distribution** → Estimates the probability of a **rare event happening within a fixed time** (e.g., number of calls received per hour 📞).  

✏️ **Key Functions:**  
- **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** → Gives the probability of a discrete random variable taking specific values.  
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** → Gives the probability that the random variable is **less than or equal to** a certain value.

---

## 📈 **Continuous Probability Distributions**  
Continuous distributions deal with **measurable** values that can take infinitely many possibilities (e.g., height, weight, stock prices 📉). The **total area under the probability curve** must be **1**.

### 📌 **Common Types of Continuous Distributions:**  
1️⃣ **Uniform Distribution** → Probability is evenly spread across an interval (e.g., random number generator 🎛).  
2️⃣ **Normal Distribution (Gaussian)** → Bell-shaped curve describing many natural phenomena (e.g., human height distribution 📏).  

✏️ **Key Functions:**  
- **Probability Density Function (PDF)** → Represents probability for continuous values.  
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** → Probability that the continuous random variable is **less than or equal to** a given value.

---

## 🎯 **Probability Estimation Methods**  
Probability estimation helps determine unknown probabilities based on observed data.

### 🔹 **Frequentist Approach:**  
- Relies on **historical data and direct observation**.  
- Example: The probability of rain tomorrow is based on past weather records.  

### 🔹 **Bayesian Approach:**  
- Updates probabilities dynamically as **new evidence** is received.  
- Example: Spam filters refine predictions based on incoming emails.  

---

## 🌍 **Real-World Applications:**  
✅ Stock market trends use **Normal Distribution** for price predictions.  
✅ **Binomial Distribution** helps e-commerce sites estimate **customer purchase probability**.  
✅ **Poisson Distribution** is useful for **traffic modeling and call center management**.

# 🎲 Uniform Distribution: Rolling a Die  

A **Uniform Distribution** is when all possible outcomes have **equal probability**. Rolling a **fair six-sided die** is a perfect example!

---


## 📊 **Understanding Uniform Distribution:**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1b6b2c0-87d1-414e-9738-eb121ad79cd9)

- A standard die has **six faces** (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).  
- Each face has an **equal chance** of appearing.  
- The **probability of rolling any number** is:

P(X) = 1/6 = 0.1667 approx.

- Since all outcomes are equally likely, the sum of all probabilities must be **1**:

P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) + P(6) = 1

---

## 📈 **Probability Mass Function (PMF) & Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**  

Here is a visual representation of uniform distribution using **PMF** and **CDF**:

### 🟦 **PMF (Probability Mass Function)**
- This shows that **each die roll has the same probability (1/6)**.

### 📈 **CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)**
- This accumulates probabilities as numbers increase, reaching **1** at roll **6**.

---

## 🔍 **Key Insights:**  
✅ **Uniform distribution applies when all possible outcomes are equally probable.**  
✅ **Rolling a fair die follows uniform distribution since every number has an equal chance of appearing.**  
✅ **PMF and CDF help visualize probability behavior.**  

---

# 🎲 Binomial Distribution  

The **Binomial Distribution** models **repeated Bernoulli trials**, where each trial has only **two possible outcomes**—success or failure. It’s widely used in probability and statistics, especially for **counting the number of successes** in a set of experiments. 🚀  

---

## 🔹 **Bernoulli Trial**  
A **Bernoulli trial** is an experiment where the outcome is limited to **two choices**:  
✅ **Success or Failure**  
✅ **Yes or No**  
✅ **Heads or Tails**  

📌 **Examples:**  
- Tossing a coin **once** → **Bernoulli Trial** (Outcomes: H or T)  
- Checking if a person is **healthy or sick** → **Bernoulli Trial**  
- Turning a switch **On or Off** → **Bernoulli Trial**  

---

## 🔢 **Binomial Distribution**  
If a **Bernoulli trial** is **repeated multiple times**, it forms a **Binomial Distribution**.  

📌 **Example:**  
🎲 **Tossing a coin 10 times** → Binomial Distribution (Counting how many heads appear).  

💡 **Key Insight:** The two outcomes **don’t always have equal probabilities**.  

📌 **Example:**  
- A **fruit basket** has **7 apples & 3 oranges**.  
- Probability of picking an **apple (A)** → **P(A) = 7/10**  
- Probability of picking an **orange (O)** → **P(O) = 3/10**  

Even though there are only **two outcomes**, they don’t have equal probabilities.  

---

## 🏗 **Examples of Bernoulli Trials & Binomial Distributions**  

### 1️⃣ **Tossing a Coin Once**  
✅ **Uniform Probability:** P(H) = P(T) = **0.5**  
✅ **Bernoulli Trial:** **Only two outcomes (H or T)**  
✅ **Binomial Distribution:** ✅ (**Because it is a Bernoulli trial, done once**)  

---

### 2️⃣ **Throwing a Dice**  
❌ **Not a Bernoulli Trial** → Because **six outcomes** exist (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  
❌ **Not a Binomial Distribution** → Since it’s **not a Bernoulli trial**.  

---

### 3️⃣ **Drawing a Marble from a Jar**  
- **Jar contains 5 red (R) & 3 blue (B) marbles**  
- **Probability of Red:** **P(R) = 5/8**  
- **Probability of Blue:** **P(B) = 3/8**  
✅ **Bernoulli Trial:** Only two possible outcomes (R or B).  
✅ **Binomial Distribution:** If multiple draws occur (tracking how often Red appears).  

---

---

## 📌 **Characteristics of Binomial Distribution:**  
1️⃣ **Fixed Number of Trials (n):**  
   - The experiment is performed **n** times (e.g., flipping a coin **10 times**).  

2️⃣ **Each Trial Has Two Outcomes:**  
   - **Success (e.g., getting heads)** or **Failure (e.g., getting tails)**.  

3️⃣ **Probability of Success (p) is Constant:**  
   - The probability of **getting heads** remains **constant (p = 0.5)** across all trials.  

4️⃣ **Trials are Independent:**  
   - The outcome of one trial **does not affect** the outcome of another.

# Given data
n = 7  # Total students
k = 2  # Students preferring online learning
p = 0.55  # Probability of success
q = 1 - p  # Probability of failure

# Binomial Probability Formula
probability = comb(n, k) * (p ** k) * (q ** (n - k))

print(f"The probability that exactly {k} out of {n} students prefer online learning is: {probability:.4f} or {probability*100:.2f}%")
```

# 📊 Understanding PMF & CDF  

Probability Mass Function (**PMF**) and Cumulative Distribution Function (**CDF**) help describe the behavior of a random variable. Let’s break them down with clear explanations and real-life examples! 🚀  

---

## 🔢 **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**  

The **PMF** provides the probability of a discrete random variable **taking a specific value**. In simple terms, it tells us:  
👉 "What is the probability of exactly **X** occurrences?"  

📌 **Example: Tip Percentages in a Restaurant**  
Suppose we define **success** as a tip **≥ 15%** of the total bill amount. The PMF calculates probabilities for different numbers of successful tips.  

- **P(X = 0)** → Probability that **none** of the tips are at least 15%.  
- **P(X = 1)** → Probability that **exactly one** tip is at least 15%.  
- **P(X = 2)** → Probability that **exactly two** tips are at least 15%.  

PMF deals with **individual probabilities** at **specific points**.

## 📈 **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**  

The **CDF** provides the probability that a random variable is **less than or equal to** a given value. Instead of looking at exact occurrences like PMF, CDF looks at cumulative probabilities.

📌 **Example: Tip Percentages in a Restaurant**  
Using the same dataset:  
- **P(X ≤ 0)** → Probability that **none** of the tips are at least 15%.  
- **P(X ≤ 1)** → Probability that **at most one** tip is at least 15%.  
- **P(X ≤ 2)** → Probability that **at most two** tips are at least 15%.  

CDF **adds up** probabilities as the number of successes increases.

## 🎯 **Key Differences:**  
| Feature | PMF | CDF |
|---------|----|----|
| **Definition** | Probability of exact values | Probability up to a given value |
| **Type** | Discrete points | Accumulated probabilities |
| **Purpose** | Find chances of specific outcomes | Track overall probability growth |

---

## 🌍 **Why is this Important?**  
PMF and CDF are widely used in **finance, machine learning, risk analysis, and business analytics** to evaluate probability distributions efficiently.
